When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- when you have access to the internet and want to pull new changes not made by you or by you on a different computer.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of the other?
- fork is a remote copy of someone elses repository on git hub.
- clone is a local copy of either a loval repository or your own remote repository.
- A branch is a copy intended to run alongside the master branch for experimenta purposes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- you can work on the latest version whilst having no internet connection.
